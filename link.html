        <h2 id="section1">What are Human Rights?</h2>
        <p>
            Human rights are the basic rights and freedoms that belong to every person in the world, from birth until death. They apply regardless of where you are from, what you believe or how you choose to live your life.They can never be taken away, although they can sometimes be restricted â€“ for example if a person breaks the law, or in the interests of national security.These basic rights are based on shared values like dignity, fairness, equality, respect and independence. These values are defined and protected by law.In Britain our human rights are protected by the Human Rights Act 1998.
